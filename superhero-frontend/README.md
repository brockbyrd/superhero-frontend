# GETTING STARTED

    npm start or yarn start

# APPLICATION DETAILS

    This application is a database for superheros and villains. It shows their attributes in numbers such as strength, speed, and others.
    The startup of the application starts you on a homepage that renders two images one of a group of Superheroes and another one of Villains. 
    You click on whichever side you  would like to choose to see. 
    The left side renders all of the superheroes in the database and the right side renders all of villains. 
    The front of the cards will render the picture of the character and their base numerical stats. 
    The card has a button to flip the card over to give you more detail about the character you choose.

# BACKEND

    The backend for the application is created with Ruby on Rails. This is the GitHub link for the backend.
